This pressurized lifestyle can adversely affect mental and emotional health, and even be a cause of suicide or death by overwork (karoshi).

Casual workers may be able to work fewer hours, but their pay often only covers basic living costs, and they don't receive the same benefits as permanent employees.

Sundays may be the only day people have to recuperate from a tiring week. For Christians, attending church on their only day off can feel like just another thing to do. Non-Christians who are interested in the gospel may simply not have the time or energy to take the next steps. 

Thankfully, there are signs that the work culture may be gradually changing. Many in the younger generation are seeking a better work/life balance and the government is introducing some new initiatives.
